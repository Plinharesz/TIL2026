# Encode and Decode Strings

## Description

Design an algorithm to **encode** a list of strings into a single string and **decode** it back into the original list of strings.

The encoding method must correctly handle empty strings, spaces, and special characters.

## Expected Functions

- `encode`: takes a list of strings and returns a single encoded string.
- `decode`: takes the encoded string and returns the original list of strings.

## Example

Input:
["hello", "world"]

Output after decode:
["hello", "world"]

## Notes

- There are no restrictions on how the encoded string is formatted, as long as the decoding process can accurately reconstruct the original list.
- The solution should work for any valid list of strings.
