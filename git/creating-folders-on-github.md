How to Create Folders on Github Web Interface

**Date:** Jan 02, 2026

To create a folder, you need to create a file inside it at same time using the slash `/`trick.

1. CLick on **add file** > **Create new file**.
2. In the filename field, type the folder name followed by a slash.
   - Example: `git/new-file.md`
3. GitHub automatically converts the text before the `/` into a folder.
