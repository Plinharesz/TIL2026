## Recent History

### January
- [Jan 01] - Happy new year!
- [Jan 02] - Project setup & [How to create folders on github](./git/creating-folders-on-github.md).
- [Jan 03] - Refreshed core concepts of [Arrays](./algorithms/Arrays)  and [HashMaps](./algorithms/HashMaps) to start my Data Structures & Algorithms journey.
- [Jan 04] - First [LeetCode](./LeetCode) exercise done ([ContainsDuplicate](./LeetCode/ContainsDuplicate217)).
- [Jan 05] - Learned about [HashSet](./algorithms/HashSets) and implemented 3 solutions for Contains Duplicate ([Brute Force](./LeetCode/ContainsDuplicate217/containsDuplicate_bruteForce.java) vs [Sorting](./LeetCode/ContainsDuplicate217/containsDuplicate_sorting.java) vs [HashSet](./LeetCode/ContainsDuplicate217/containsDuplicate_hashSet.java)).
- [Jan 06] - Second LeetCode exercise done ([ValidAnagram](./LeetCode/ValidAnagram242)).
- [Jan 07] - I went back to see more about hashset because I didn't get it well enough.
- [Jan 08] - Tried to solve the third LeetCode [TwoSum](./LeetCode/TwoSum01). the Logic has already been understood, but trying to pass to code.
- [Jan 09] - [Solve TwoSum](./LeetCode/TwoSum01/twoSum.java) exercise with brute force method.
- [Jan 10] - I redid the three leetcode exercises of the week to fix the knowledge.
- [Jan 11] - *Day Off*
- [Jan 12] - Started organizing the repository structure for [Arrays](./algorithms/Arrays), [HashMaps](./algorithms/HashMaps), and [HashSets](./algorithms/HashSets).
- [Jan 13] - Tried to solve 4th LeetCode [GroupAnagrams](./LeetCode/GroupAnagrams49). The logic has already been understood, but trying to pass to code.
- [Jan 14] - [Solve groupAnagrams](./LeetCode/GroupAnagrams49/groupAnagrams.java) exercise with sorting solution.
- [Jan 15] - Redid previous exercises to fix concepts and tried to solve [TopKFrequentElements](./LeetCode/TopKFrequentElements347).
- [Jan 16] - Tried to solve [Top K Frequent Elements](./LeetCode/TopKFrequentElements347/topKFrequentElements.java) (first exercise classified as medium level) 
- [Jan 17] - *Day Off*
- [Jan 18] - Created folder about [Arrays & Hashing](./algorithms/Arrays&Hashing) and another with [Commit Message Tips](./git/commit-messages.md) for best practices and use cases.
